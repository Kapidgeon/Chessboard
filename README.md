# Chessboard
As I continue learning HTML and CSS, I decided to try to create a chessboard with chess pieces (only using  HTML and CSS so far).
Also thinking through how the rows and columns can be numbered like other real chessboards.
Eventually, want to possibly make it a playable interactive game app (not sure how to do this just yet.)
The HTML and CSS code shows what I thought was the best way to create a chessboard with my current understanding.
